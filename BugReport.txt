Bugs:

Rotation causes the app to die. -Fixed by forcing the app to only work in portait mode
Writes an external file of acc and gyro data, but
	sometimes makes multiple saves of same data in file
Must update runtime permission
Fairly certain we do not have a service running that does the data collection.
